# NewBechdelTest

In our final project, we examine 50 Hollywood movies using different evaluation frameworks inspired by the Bechdel-Wallace test. 
The Bechdel test determines if a movie satisfies two main criteria: 
(1) there are at least two named female characters and 
(2) these characters have at least one conversation that is not about a man. 
While a good starting point, this test falls short in addressing other aspects of inequality inherent in plot development, actor/actress gender ratios, and the movie industry at large. We create our own feminist framework, which takes a combination of alternative tests inspired by the Bechdel test, to assess all facets of a movie, from the production process to the finished product.
